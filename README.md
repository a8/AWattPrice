# ⚡️ AWattPrice ⚡️

A app that displays data retrieved from the public aWATTar API.

aWATTar is an electricty provider who offers the customer to not pay a fixed price for electricity. Instead the customer only needs to pay as much for the electricity as it currently costs at stock exchange 📉. This is possible because the electricity price changes every hour. There are different tariffs which all have different degrees of risk.

🌍 Supported regions: Germany 🇩🇪 and Austria 🇦🇹
