An app that displays electricity prices retrieved from the public aWATTar API.

aWATTar is an electricty provider, where customers don't pay a fix price for electricity, but instead pay as much for the electricity as it currently costs at stock exchange 📉. This is possible because the electricity price changes every hour.

🌍 Supported regions: Germany 🇩🇪 and Austria 🇦🇹

Current features are:

* View electricity prices throughout the day
* Find the hours when electricity is cheapest (e.g.: find cheapest time to charge electric car, turn on the washing machine or run other electrical consumers)
